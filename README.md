                    Ton is a Stone Payments spin-off startup offering financial solutions for small and micro-entrepreneurs, having its main product low-cost card payment machines. Python libs and SQL were used to perform it.
                    <br><br>
                    The goal of the project was to answer the following questions:
                    <ol>
                      <li>A new feature was implemented on the 1st of August on the TON website that they believe will decrease the amount of incoming calls related to our product. Assess whether the implementation had a statistically significant impact.</li>
                      <li>It was noticed by some RC agents that more recent customers have a specific behavior in relation to the number of calls made right after their accreditation. Prepare some way to visualize this difference noticed by agents.</li>
                      <li>In order to improve the quality of customer service, it was proposed that the waiting list for service includes a priority for certain service cases. Propose a clustering of the customer base that you think best meets the presented need.</li>
                      <li>Using the tables provided, make a query that returns the volume of calls per week for the last three months for each customer cluster proposed in question 3.</li>
                      <li>To improve the direction of the Customer Relations area, the management needs the necessary input to understand how our customers behave and thus improve decision making. Present at least 3 KPI's that you judge relevant for daily monitoring of the RC operation.</li>
                    </ol>
